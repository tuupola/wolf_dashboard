*HEADS UP!* Order of $ident and $priority parameters was changed. Code is backward compatible. Still, from now on you should now use the following code in your plugins:

*NOTE!* Database schema was changed. Either disable and enable the plugin after upgrading to recreate the table. This will cause you to lose your history. If you do not want to loose history run the following SQL by hand.

<pre>
<code>
ALTER TABLE <table_prefix>_dashboard_log 
ADD COLUMN username VARCHAR(64) 
AFTER message;
</code>
</pre>
